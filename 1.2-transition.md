==========

Not to be confused with the swagger framework versioning, the swagger specification itself is versioned for compatibility.  You can see information about previous versions in the [wiki](Changelog).

Philosophically, any changes to the spec are absorbed into the tools for one-version backwards compatibility.  So the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) will work with both swagger-spec 1.1 and 1.2.  It is not tested against older versions (prior to 1.1).  Changing a specification typically causes some heartache and pain, so the changes introduced are usually not just for fun--they have a history of issues or confusion behind them, which mandates the chage.

That said, here's a transition guide for the 1.2 specification.

### 1.0  Resource Listing

#### Changes

* The `swaggerVersion` should report `1.2` for proper detection.

* The resource listing no longer requires a `basePath`.

* The `path` element now supports relative and absolute paths.  Relative paths are considered to be relative to the Resource Listing.

#### Why the changes?

The absolute path allows Resource Listings to easily point to multiple servers, so a Resource Listing can be an "uber directory" of apis.  Next, the `basePath` at the resource listing was serving a different purpose than at the Api Declaration, causing much confusion.  Finally, the `basePath` for Resource Listing was an additional configuration to mess up.

#### Additions

* An `authorizations` section was added to define what authorization schemes were supported for the API.  See the [authorizations](authorizations) section for details on this section.  It is not required for 1.2 complicane.

* An `info` section was added to define metadata about the API.  It too is optional but highly recommended--the metadata is also presented directly in the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) console for easy access.  See the [API Info](api-info) section for details.

### 2.0  API Declaration

#### Changes

* The `swaggerVersion` should report `1.2` for proper detection.

* The `resourcePath` now must start with a forward slash "/"

* The `path` inside the `apis` array must start with a forward slash

* Each `operation` element can contain an optional `responseMessages` value.  This was renamed from `errorResponses`.

* The `parameters` has been updated to support JSON-sechema v4 format.  See the `Models` section for detials.

* Each element in the `responseMessages` array contains an integer `code` and string `message` field.  Previously, the analogous `errorResponse` attributes were named `code` and `reason` respectively.

* The `responseMessage` element may contain an optional `responseModel` attribute to indicate a different object type as a return value depending on the `code` which typically maps to http response codes.

* The `dataType` field has been renamed to `type` for consistency with the JSON-schema v4 draft spec.  See section 2.1 for more details

* The `allowableValues` field has been absorbed into an `enum` for LIST type, and `minimum` + `maximum` for ranges

#### Additions

* The API Declaration supports a `produces` array, which is an array of strings.  These apply to all operations in the API unless overridden at the API level.

* The API Declaration supports a `consumes` array, which is an array of strings.  These apply to all operations in the API unless overridden at the API level.

* Elements in the `operations` array can contain the following arrays:  `consumes`, `produces`, `authorizations`, `protocols`.  These values override any existing values at the API Declaration

#### Why the changes?

The `path` and `resourcePath` attributes were inconsistent with leading slashes, causing unnecessary validations.

For the `errorResponses` array, many non-200 response codes are actually *not* errors.  This made the `reason` not make sense (`reason` implies an error state) and often different response codes need to return different data.  Such as a 400 response code might include information as to *why* in the payload.

### 2.1  API Declaration models

#### Additions

* Models are now described with [JSON-Schema Draft 4](http://json-schema.org/).  This creates multiple changes:

- Datatypes now confirm to the JSON Schema specification.  The use of the `format` attribute is used to make up for the more coarse-grained type specification, as shown after the comma in Swagger spec 1.2 below.

| Common name | Swagger spec 1.2  | Swagger spec 1.1  |
|:----------- |:-----------------:| -----------------:|
| integer     | integer, int32    | int               |
| long        | integer, int64    | long              |
| float       | number, float     | float             |
| double      | number, double    | double            |
| string      | string            | string            |
| byte        | string, byte      | byte              |
| boolean     | boolean           | boolean           |
| date        | string, date      | Date              |
| dateTime    | string, date-time | Date              |

- Required fields are now annotated at the model-level as opposed to the field level.  For example, the `id` and `name` fields are required:

```json
"Pet" : {
  "id" : "Pet",
  "required" : [
    "id",
    "name"
  ],
  "properties" : {
    "name" : {
      "type" : "string"
    },
```

- Containers have a slightly different representation from the 1.1 spec, again changed to reflect the JSON-schema draft-4

| Common name | Swagger spec 1.2        | Swagger spec 1.1  |
|:----------- |:-----------------------:| -----------------:|
| List        | array                   | List              |
| Array       | array                   | Array             |
| Set         | array, uniqueItems=true | Set               |


* Models can now contain a `extends` attribute which indicate that one model extends another.  It is assumed that the subclass contains the union of properties between itself and its superclass

* Models can contain a `discriminator` field which, in conjunction with a `extends`, can be used for polymorphic models.

#### Why the changes?

The model specification as JSON-schema opens the ability for more consistent model descriptions.  The previous version
of swagger models was based on a JSON-schema draft but it has been brought up to spec with draft-4, which is gaining good
adoption.

These changes are introduced largely by the swagger community.  They reflect a lot of hard work, convincing, emails, IRC chats, and good intentions.  If you use swagger, thank your fellow swagger contributors!
