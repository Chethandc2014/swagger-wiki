### How to contribute
Community contributions have made Swagger a better specification and framework.  If you are interested in contributing, please follow these simple guidelines.

1.  Use the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket) for questions.  Issues should be opened if you find a problem in the product or have an enhancement request.

2.  Use [Coding Standards](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Coding-Standards) to keep the code consistent and simplify merging.

3.  Supply test cases.  If you don't we can't see if your code is working or not, or is broken in the future.
