This doclet generator will produce swagger documentation at compile-time, making it a pseudo-server integration.  It reads the source code and statically creates the swagger JSON.

Per the developer's site, the doclet will create a JSON file at `apidocs/services.json` which is readable by swagger-ui.

Please follow the instructions on the project wiki for doing so:
